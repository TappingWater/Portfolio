## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my digital home. I built this space to share a bit about what I do and stuff I've learned along the way. It's made with NextJs, got some cool animations thanks to FramerMotion, and is styled using TailwindCSS. Oh, and it's hosted on Vercel, so it loads pretty darn fast!

## Some Highlights:

### My Bash-Inspired Home
First up, my homepage! I had some fun creating a typewriter thing that feels like a bash terminal. And if you move around, you'll see my little avatar trying to follow. It's like a mini-game!

### Projects I'm Proud Of
Here's where I show off a bit! Every project I've worked on taught me something new. Check them out and see what I've been up to.

### Thoughts & Ramblings
Every now and then, I write. It could be about a coding challenge or just what's on my mind. I used MDX for this, which is super cool if you're into that sort of thing.

### All About The Details
Each blog post and project page has its own look. I spent some time making sure they feel just right. Plus, they're easy to read, which is always a win!

### It Works Everywhere!
I made sure the site looks good whether you're on a phone, tablet, or desktop. Took a bit of testing, but I'm happy with the results!
