## Overview
Personal portfolio site created to display my skills and share my thoughts. This site was 
created using NextJs with the help of FramerMotion and TailwindCSS to improve UI/UX design
and deployed to Vercels' edge network.

## Features
Home page was designed as the default landing page. Made use of animated text to create a 
typewriter effect similar to that of a bash terminal and added code to follow mouse and tap 
movements using the avatars' eyes.

Projects page was designed to display completed projects with details regarding skills with a brief
overview. Content is generated as static content with the help of content layer and NextJS's static site
generation. Made use of framer motion to improve UX  such as scaling on click and transitioning x 
coordinates uponfilter:

Blog page was designed to share thoughts regarding programming problems and everyday life. Blog 
page was designed similar to projects with the help of Content Layer. Blog files are dynamically
generated from written MDX files.

Both individual blog posts as well as project pages that are dynamically generated using computed
slugs have been styled and made responsive using TailwindCSS. Additionally remark and rehype have been
used to improve the readability of these generated pages.
