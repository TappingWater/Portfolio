summary: Understanding the basics of regular expressions
---
## Overview
- Regular expressions are  one of the most fundamental tools used in Natural Language processing. 
- Used to search for strings using a pattern.
- Platform independent: same regex used in your favorite programming language can be used in a text editor like VSCode.
- With regular expressions you can return a single match or an entire list of them that match the pattern.
- There are many variants of regular expressions.  This article will dwell into extended regular expressions.
- Regular expressions are case sensitive. (Therefore, One != one)
- Regular expressions are greedy by default.

## Follow along 
- An interactive python notebook with code referencing this examples can be found at: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16DvpmCOBsb3HCDbGNK42ykUNh5a8t9l9?usp=sharing)

## Sequences
- An ordered combination of one or more characters.

Ex: 

For the sentence: **once upon a time in oncelot, there was once a roncean**
| Expression | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
| once | 4: <u>once</u> upon a time in <u>once</u>lot, there was <u>once</u> a r<u>once</u>an | characters **o**,**n**,**c**,**e** in order |

## Disjunction
- Disjunction allows us to search for strings with variations.
- The number of possible variations that are allowed for a string are enclosed in square brackets. (**[]**)
- For example, if we have a string: "Natural habitats with natural biology are affected by natural disasters".
- There are a few characters that when used within a square bracket give a special meaning: "^", "-".
- **-**: is used to define a range.
- For example, if we want to search for all numbers we can use: [0123456789].
- However, this is quite bothersome and tiring, this is where we can use: [0-9] to signify a range of 0 to 9.
- **^**: Used to denote negation.
- **^** has to be the first character within square brackets for it to count as negation.
- If **^** appears at a different position within square brackets such as the middle it denotes a normal "^" sign.

Ex:

For the text: **Natural habitats with natural biology are affected by natural disasters**
| Expression | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
| natural | 2: Natural habitats with <u>natural</u> biology are affected by <u>natural</u> disasters | sequence of "natural" |
| Natural | 1: <u>Natural</u> habitats with natural biology are affected by natural disasters | sequence of "Natural" |
| [nN]atural | 3: <u>Natural</u> habitats with <u>natural</u> biology are affected by <u>natural</u> disasters | sequence of both "Natural" and "natural" |

For the text: **abcAZ907** 
| Expression | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
| [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz] | 3: <u>a</u><u>b</u><u>c</u>AZ907 | any lower case character |
| [a-z] | 3: <u>a</u><u>b</u><u>c</u>AZ907 | any lowercase character |
| a[a-z] | 1: <u>ab</u>cAZ907 | a followed by any lowercase character |
| [7-9] | 2: abcAZ<u>9</u>0<u>7</u> | digits 7, 8 or 9 |

For the text: **abcAZ907**
| Expression | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
| [^abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz] | 6: abc<u>A</u><u>Z</u><u>9</u><u>0</u><u>7</u><u>^</u> | any character that is not a lowercase letter |
| [^a-z] | 6: abc<u>A</u><u>Z</u><u>9</u><u>0</u><u>7</u><u>^</u> | any character that is not a lowercase letter |
| [7^9] | 3: abcAZ<u>9</u>0<u>7</u><u>^</u> | digits 7 or 9 or character ^ |
| [^7^9] | 6: <u>a</u><u>b</u><u>c</u><u>A</u><u>Z</u>9<u>0</u>7^ | any character other than digits 7 or 9 or character ^ |

## Counters 
- Counters allow us to define patterns with a variable number of a characters.
- **?**: Zero or one instance.
- **\***: Zero or more instances
- **+**: One or more instances 
- **\{number\}**: Specific number of instances 

Ex: 

For the text: **The word color is sometimes referred to as colour in some interpretations.**
| Expression | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
| color | 1: The word <u>color</u> is sometimes referred to as colour in some interpretations. | sequence of color |
| colour | 1: The word color is sometimes referred to as <u>colour</u> in some interpretations. | sequence of colour |
| colou?r | 2: The word <u>color</u> is sometimes referred to as <u>colour</u> in some interpretations. | sequence of color or colour |

For the expression: **ba\*!**
| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
| b! | 1: <u>b!</u> | character 'b' followed by zero or more 'a' followed by '!' |
| ba! | 1: <u>ba!</u> | character 'b' followed by zero or more 'a' followed by '!' |
| baaaaaa! | 1: <u>baaa!</u> | character 'b' followed by zero or more 'a' followed by '!' |

For the expression: **ba\+!**
| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
| b! | 0: b! | character 'b' followed by one or more 'a' followed by '!' |
| ba! | 1: <u>ba!</u> | character 'b' followed by one or more 'a' followed by '!' |
| baaaaaa! | 1: <u>baaa!</u> | character 'b' followed by one or more 'a' followed by '!' |

For the text: **baaaaa!**
| Expression | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
| ba\{5\}! | 1: <u>baaaaa!</u> | character b followed by 5 a's followed by ! |
| ba\{4\}! | 0: baaaaa! | character b followed by 4 a's followed by ! |
| ba\{3, 6\}! |  1: <u>baaaaa!</u> | character b followed by a minimum of 3 a's upto a maximum of 6 a's followed by ! |
| ba\{4, \}! | 1: <u>baaaaa!</u> | character b followed by a minium of 4 a's followed by ! |
| ba\{, 3\}! | 0: baaaaa! | character b followed by a maximum of 3 a's followed by ! |
| ba\{, 6\}! | 1: <u>baaaaa!</u> | character b followed by a maximum of 6 a's followed by ! |

## Anchors

- Regular expressions used to denote a particular place for a string.
- **^**: Used to denote the start of a line. 
- **$**: Used to denote the end of a line. 
- **\b**: Used to denote a word boundary.
- **\B**: Used to denote a non word boundary. 
- A **word** in regex: sequence of letters, digits and underscores(**_**).
- Thus, special characters like "$" or "!" will not count as a word boundary

Ex: 

For python specifically, you need to enable the multiline flag to identify new lines:
<CodeBlock title="Regex Setup for processing new line characters">
  ```python
flags = re.MULTILINE if multiline else 0
compiled_pattern = re.compile(pattern, flags)
matches = compiled_pattern.finditer(text)
```
</CodeBlock>

|an\$d|1: There was the person that was running t^he shop <u>an$d</u> they came and $99 went.The shop opened next day the|The sequence 'an$d'|

For the text: **The man wrote a thesis on rafther and there were others who read it and the people who read it were satisfied. The_ $99! price was on$the tag with an id code of \_99\_ 99a.**
| Expression | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|\b[Tt]he\b|3: <u>The</u> man wrote a thesis on rafther and there were others who read it and <u>the</u> people who read it were satisfied. The_ $99! price was on$<u>the</u> tag with an id code of \_99\_ 99a.|sequence of 'The' or 'the' with no letters, digits or underscores on either side of the sequence separated by a whitespace |

The_ $99! price was on$the tag with an id code of \_99\_ 99a.|sequence of the such that there are no letters, digits or underscores to the left before a whitespace character and a letter, digit or underscore to the right before a whitespace |

## Wildcard character
- **.** : Used to denote the possibility of any character 
![wildcard](/blog/regex/giphy.gif)

Ex: 

For the expression **te.m**
| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|team|1: <u>team</u>|sequence of 'te' followed by any character followed by 'm'|
|te!m|1: <u>te!m</u>|sequence of 'te' followed by any character followed by 'm'|
|tem|0: tem|sequence of 'te' followed by any character followed by 'm'|
|te m|1: <u>te m</u>|sequence of 'te' followed by any character followed by 'm'|
|te am|0: te am|sequence of 'te' followed by any character followed by 'm'|

For the expression **te.\*m**
| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|tem|1: <u>tem</u>|sequence of 'te' followed by zero of more of any character followed by 'm'|
|te am|1: <u>te am</u>|sequence of 'te' followed by zero of more of any character followed by 'm'|
|te aasdsad1m|1: <u>te as1asdasd as m</u>|sequence of 'te' followed by zero of more of any character followed by 'm'|

## Order precedence
- The most important part of understanding a regex is understanding precedence. 
- Lets say we have the regex **one|two** which means search for a string with a sequence of **one** or **two** but for **onewo** or **ontwo**.
- Consider boe* which means search for a string with the sequence bo with zero or more occurrences of e but not for **boeboe** or **boeboeboe**.
- This is due to order precedence. 
- Certain operators have a higher order of precedence and evaluated first similar to algebra.
- Similar to evaluating an algebraic expression, regex also needs to be evaluated in order.
- Parenthesis allows us to increase the order of precedence

Order of precedence is as follow:
| Operator | Symbols |
|----------|----------|
|Parenthesis|()|
|Counters|*,  +,  ?,  \{\}|
|Sequences and Anchors|sequence, ^, $, \b, \B|
|Disjunction| \| |

- Since Disjunction has lower precedence than Sequences: one|two the two sequences one and two are first evaluated then the disjunction.
- Since counters have higher priority than sequences: boe* the sequence is evaluated after and counter is applied to the character to its left.
- However with parenthesis we can manipulate the order to our liking
- If we want to search for onewo or ontwo instead of one or two we can use the regex:  **on(e|t)wo**
- If we want to search for poepoepoe where the string poe is repeated 0 or more times: **(poe)***

Ex: 

For the expression **poe***
| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|po|1: <u>po</u>|sequence of 'po' followed by 0 or more 'e's|
|poeee|1: <u>poeeee</u>|sequence of 'po' followed by 0 or more e's|
|poepoe|1: <u>poe</u>poe|sequence of 'po' followed by 0 or more e's|

For the expression: **(poe)***
| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|poepoe|2: <u>poe</u><u>poe</u>|sequence of 'poe' repeated 0 or more times|
||1: <u></u>|sequence of 'poe' repeated 0 or more times|

For the expression: **one|two**
| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|one|1: <u>one</u>|sequence of 'one' or 'two'|
|two|1: <u>two</u>|sequence of 'one' or 'two'|
|one two|2: <u>one</u> <u>two</u>|sequence of 'one' or 'two'|
|onewo|1: on<u>two</u>|sequence of 'one' or 'two'|
|ontwo|1: <u>one</u>wo|sequence of 'one' or 'two'|

For the expression: **on(e|t)wo**
| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|one|0: one|sequence of 'on' followed by either 'e' or 't' followed by a sequence of 'wo'|
|two|0: two|sequence of 'on' followed by either 'e' or 't' followed by a sequence of 'wo'|
|one two|0: one two|sequence of 'on' followed by either 'e' or 't' followed by a sequence of 'wo'|
|onewo|1: <u>ontwo</u>|sequence of 'on' followed by either 'e' or 't' followed by a sequence of 'wo'|
|ontwo|1: <u>onewo</u>|sequence of 'on' followed by either 'e' or 't' followed by a sequence of 'wo'|

## Other special characters:
- These characters are mainly used as shorthand for common patterns:

| Characters | Expansion | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|\d|[0-9]|any digit|
|\D|[^0-9]|any non digit|
|\w|[a-zA-Z0-9_]|any uppercase or lowercase letter or digit or underscore|
|\W|[^\w]|any character that is not a letter, digit or underscore|
|\s|[\r\t\n\f]| any whitespace, tab or newline
|\S|[^\s]|non whitespace

## Greedy expressions 
- Regular expressions are greedy by default.
- Lets say we have a input string of **"His name was poeee"** to which we apply the regular expression **"poe*"**.
- The regular expression searches for a string with a sequence of 'po' followed by 0 or more e's.
- Now given our input string it can return po, poe, poee or poeee.
- However, from these options the string that will be returned as an output would be poeee.
- This is because regex are greedy and will try to match the expression to the longest possible string.
- However, we can also enforce a non-greedy approach by using the **?** symbol along with the **\*** or **+** symbols.

Ex:

For the text: His name was poeee
| Expression | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|poe*|1: His name was <u>poeee</u>|The longest string match of the sequence 'po' followed by 0 or more e's|
|poe+|1: His name was <u>poeee</u>|The longest string match of the sequence 'po' followed by 1 or more e's|
|poe*?|1: His name was <u>po</u>eee|The shortest string match of the sequence 'po' followed by 0 or more e's|
|poe+?|1: His name was <u>poe</u>ee|The shortest string match of the sequence 'po' followed by 1 or more e's|

## Substitutions and Capture Groups
- In addition to changing the default order of precedence, parenthesis(**()**) can also be used to capture and store patterns.
- If a pattern within a parenthesis matches an expression that pattern gets stored in a memory register.
- For example lets say we have an input string of: **He was big but his opponent was bigger**.
- We then apply a regular expression to it of: **He was (.)\* but his opponent was \1ger**.
- This expression will create a valid match as the parenthesis matches the string **big** and stores it within a memory register references by **\1**.

Ex:

For the expression: **He was (.*) but his opponent was \1er**

| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|He was big but his opponent was biger|1: <u>He was big but his opponent was biger</u>|The parenthesis captures the sequence between was and but and stores it in register referenced by \1 which is big|
|He was fast but his opponent was faster|1: <u>He was fast but his opponent was faster</u>|The parenthesis captures the sequence between was and but and stores it in register referenced by \1 which is fast|
|He was fast but his opponent was biger|0: He was fast but his opponent was biger|The parenthesis captures the sequence between was and but and stores it in register referenced by \1 which is fast|

- Regular expressions are evaluated from left to right and therefore the strings matched by the expressions get stored in memory registers in order. 
- It is possible to store multiple expressions and reference them using the sequential order they are stored in.
- \1 will store the fist expression captured within parenthesis while \2 will match the second and so on.
- A common use case for these capture groups is for substitutions.

Ex:

For the input string: **42 apples, 17 bananas, 3 oranges**

Lets say we want to get the total number of fruits

<CodeBlock title="./substiution.py">
``` python
import re
# Define a regular expression pattern with capture groups
pattern = r'(\d+) (\w+)'
# Input string
text = '42 apples, 17 bananas, 3 oranges'
# Create an empty list to store fruits
fruits_list = []
count = 0
# Define a substitution function that uses captured groups
def repl(match):
    global count
    number = int(match.group(1))
    fruit = match.group(2)
    count += number  # Increment the 'count' variable
    fruits_list.append(fruit)  # Add 'fruit' to the 'fruits_list'    
    # Manipulate the captured data or construct a new string
    return f'There are {number} {fruit} in the basket.'
# Perform substitutions using re.sub()
result = re.sub(pattern, repl, text)
print('There are {0} fruits in the basket of {1}'.format(count, ','.join(fruits_list)))
print(result)
```
</CodeBlock>

This will print:
<CodeBlock title="console">
``` bash 
There are 62 fruits in the basket of apples,bananas,oranges
There are 42 apples in the basket., There are 17 bananas in the basket., There are 3 oranges in the basket.
```
</CodeBlock>

- Parenthesis by default  stores the matched expression in a memory register.
- However, there may be times we want to avoid such a behavior and use it just as a means of altering the order of precedence of an expression.
- This is where we can use the **?** symbol to denote that we want to avoid such a behavior.
- For example if we have the regex: **(? some|a few) (people|cats) like some \1**.
- The expression that will be stored in memory would be **people|cats** and not **some|few**.

Ex: 

For the expression: **(?:some|few) (people|cats) like some \1**

| Text | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|some people like some some|0: some people like some some|either the sequence 'some' or 'a few' followed by 'people' or 'cats' followed by 'like some' followed by either 'people' or 'cats' based on what was matched earlier| 
|some people like some few|0: some people like some few|either the sequence 'some' or 'a few' followed by 'people' or 'cats' followed by 'like some' followed by either 'people' or 'cats' based on what was matched earlier| 
|some people like some cats|0: some people like some cats|either the sequence 'some' or 'a few' followed by 'people' or 'cats' followed by 'like some' followed by either 'people' or 'cats' based on what was matched earlier| 
|some people like some people|1: <u>some people like some people</u>|either the sequence 'some' or 'a few' followed by 'people' or 'cats' followed by 'like some' followed by either 'people' or 'cats' based on what was matched earlier| 

## Lookahead assertions
- By default expressions are evaluated from left to right.
- Lookahead assertions allow us to scan the text ahead without advancing the match pointer.
- Lookahead assertions are denoted as either **?=** or **?!** within **()**.
- **?=** is used to check for whether the expression matches and **?!** is used to check if the expression does not match.

Ex:

For the text: **I love apple pie, but not apple juice or apple tart. apple pie is the best.**
| Expression | Matches | Meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
|apple(?= pie)|2: I love <u>apple </u>pie, but not apple juice or apple tart. <u>apple </u>pie is the best.|the sequence 'apple' followed by ' pie'|
|apple(!= pie)|2: I love apple pie, but not <u>apple </u>juice or <u>apple </u>tart. apple pie is the best.|the sequence 'apple' followed by anything but ' pie'|

## Practical examples 
- Based on the concepts above lets' use Regex for one of the most common uses in a web application.
- For testing password strength.
- Lets first define the criteria needed for a modern password:
- At,least 8 characters.
- Must contain an uppercase character, a lowercase character, a number and a symbol 
- Lets start by defining our first requirement:
- .\{8,\}
- The wildcard proceeded by a counter of a minimum of 8 ensures that our password 

<CodeBlock title="./pwdStrength.py">
```python
def test_password(password, pattern):
    compiled_pattern = re.compile(pattern)
    if compiled_pattern.match(password):
        print('Password "{0}" passes for expression: {1}\n'.format(password, pattern))
    else:
        print('Password "{0}" fails for expression: {1}\n'.format(password, pattern))

# Allow any characters (wildcard)
starting_regex = r'.*'
password1 = ''
password2 = 'abc'
password3 = 'abcdefgh'
test_password(password1, starting_regex)
test_password(password2, starting_regex)
test_password(password3, starting_regex)

# Minimum 8 characters requirement
min_char_regex = r'^.\{8,\}$'
password4 = 'abcdefghasdaaaaaaaaaaaa'
test_password(password1, min_char_regex)
test_password(password2, min_char_regex)
test_password(password3, min_char_regex)
test_password(password4, min_char_regex)

# We still dont have upper case requirement
# Our password needs to contain atleast one upper case character
# Lets use a lookahead expression to check whether there is a upper case letter
upper_case_regex = r'^(?=.*?[A-Z]).\{8,\}$'
password5 = 'aAa'
password6 = 'AVCDEFGHI'
password7 = 'asdaAdasd123'
test_password(password1, upper_case_regex)
test_password(password2, upper_case_regex)
test_password(password3, upper_case_regex)
test_password(password4, upper_case_regex)
test_password(password5, upper_case_regex)
test_password(password6, upper_case_regex)
test_password(password7, upper_case_regex)

# We still have some more requirements;
# Need a lower case, number and a special character
final_regex = r'^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-]).\{8,\}$'
password7 = 'asdaAdasd123'
password8 = 'aA2!'
password9 = '#a3aA'
password10 = 'asdaAdasd12!3'
password11 = 'Password123#'
test_password(password1, final_regex)
test_password(password2, final_regex)
test_password(password3, final_regex)
test_password(password4, final_regex)
test_password(password5, final_regex)
test_password(password6, final_regex)
test_password(password7, final_regex)
test_password(password8, final_regex)
test_password(password9, final_regex)
test_password(password10, final_regex)
test_password(password11, final_regex)
```
</CodeBlock>

This will print:
<CodeBlock title="console">
``` bash 
Password "" passes for expression: .*

- Generating a final regular expression consists of fixing two kinds of errors.
- Removing false positives. (Strings we incorrectly matched like **abc** for the expressions **.***) also called **precision**.
- Including false negatives. (Strings we missed) also called **recall**.
- We did not have false negatives in the example above but consider we had the expression instead: **^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-]).\{9,\}$**
- We would then miss passwords like "Passwo12#" with 8 characters because we defined a minimum of 9 characters in our expression.
- Such a case would be considered a false negative.
